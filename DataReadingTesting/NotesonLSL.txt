Prereqs: have EmotivPRO software and license (done)

Working with LSL Outlet
    Configuration
        Connect headset to EmotivPRO
        Settings > LSL > Outlet
            Stream name: Sets stream name for transmission, prefix of "EmotivDataStream-" combined with the data types
                Most important data type for my project is EEG
            Data stream: Choose the stream that will be transmitted, each one creates an individual LSL stream
            Data format: Either cf_float32 or cf_double64
                They say that float32 might not work as expected because the timestamp value is out of range, not sure if I need the timestamps though
            Transmit type: Either sample or Chunk
                Chunk sizes available: 4/16/32/64/128/256
                Is Chunk like the number of points sent in a single thing?
    Data Output Format (Note: Important ones for my project are EEG and maybe EEG-Quality)
        Stream/Data output format/Sample rate	
        EEG {"Timestamp", "Counter", "Interpolate", , "HardwareMarker", "Markers" }	128Hz/ 256 Hz	
        Motion {"Timestamp", "Counter", "Interpolate", "Q0","Q1","Q2","Q3", "ACCX","ACCY","ACCZ", "MAGX","MAGY","MAGZ"} 32 Hz / 64 Hz / 128 Hz	
        Performance-Metrics	{"Timestamp", "Engagement","Excitement","Focus","Interest ", "Relaxation","Stress"}	2 Hz for high resolution / 0.1 Hz for low resolution	
        Contact-Quality	{"Timestamp", "BatteryPercent", "Overall", "Signal", }	2 Hz	
        EEG-Quality	{"Timestamp","BatteryPercent","Overall","SampleRateQuality", }	2 Hz
    
Working with LSL Inlet:
    Configuration
        After setting marker via LSL, you can see the stream name in the Inlet page
        Choose one, click connect button, should see marker being added to data stream
    Data Input Format
        They only support sending markers to Inlet with 2 options
            Simple marker value: Double/int type, EmotivPRO only extracts integer part before adding to stream
                formatted like {"MarkerValue"}
            Marker with time for timing synchronization: Vector with 3 elements
                MarkerTime: epoch time of the event as a double type
                MarkerValue: same as simple marker value
                CurrentTime: current epoch time as a double type when marker is being pushed to the inlet, later than MarkerTime
                formatted like {"MarkerTime", "MarkerValue", "CurrentTime"}

Notes on using Python with LSL (https://github.com/Emotiv/labstreaminglayer/blob/master/examples/python/readme.md)

Prereqs (Both done)
    python3 version 3.7 or later (I'm using 3.9.7)
    install pylsl (python interface of LSL) with command 'pip install pylsl'

How to send marker from Python to EMOTIV LSL Inlet:
    Open SendMarker.py file and run (a python script in their github)
    Open EmotivPRO and connect to 'PyMarker' stream on EmotivPRO inlet settings (they have an example)

How to receive data from EMOTIV LSL Outlet (the more important one for my project)
    Go to LSL outlet tab, choose data stream type and data format, click start button to start streaming
    open receivedata.py file (in the github) and run
