Note: they have nice images to use

Restricted Boltzmann Machines:
    Like a binary version of factor analysis
    "For Example: If you a read a book, and then judge that book on the scale of two: 
        that is either you like the book or you do not like the book. 
        In this kind of scenarios we can use RBMs, which will help us to determine the reason behind us making those choices"
    Also known as stochastic NNs
    3 parts:
        1 input layer (visible unit)
        1 hidden layer (hidden unit)
        1 bias unit
    Steps the RBM makes in decison process:
        Compute activation energy
        Calculate sigmoid of activation energy
            gives probability, which allows hidden unit to turn on or off nodes in the visible unit

Deep Belief Networks (DBNs):
    2 phases:
        Pre-train: Multiple layers of RBMs
        Fine tune: A FF NN
    How it works:
        Find features of visbile units using Contrastive Divergence Algorithm
            Contrastive Divergence: technique to approximate gradient using a Markov chain (https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/contrastive-divergence)
        Find hidden unit features, as well as the feature of features found in above step
        When hidden layer learning phase is done, DBN is trained
